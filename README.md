# NIT RPI Analysis

I figured that since I spend a lot of my free time doing NIT bracketology I should actually make sure my conclusions were grounded in some sort of historical data. Here I analyzed the past five National Invitational Tournament (NIT) fields, mostly around the factor of RPI.

### Data:

[nit-participants-2010-2014.csv](): The data for every team that's played in the NIT the past five seasons. Collected from three main sources:

- Wikipedia
- Basketball State (RPI)
- My brain (Mid-Major)

This may mean that you don't necessarily agree with all the distinctions I've made around who is a mid-major school and who isn't.

### Notebooks:

[nit-bracketology-analysis.ipynb](): The analysis in an IPython Notebook, which walks through some key pieces of the RPI discussion as it relates to at-large bids in the NIT. Some rather interesting findings, especially around outliers. You can view a version of these findings without having IPython Notebook installed [here]().
